		<h3>Paper Press</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Hi. I'm PaperPress a starter theme based on _s, or underscores, and include a responsive layout base on Matthew Hartman's Base framework http://matthewhartman.github.io/base/. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for. http://paperpress.agustealo.com/</p>
